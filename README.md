# Pioneer Starter Pack
***GitHub: https://github.com/N3X15/Avorion-PioneerStarterPack***

This is an open-source, translated version of [开拓者礼包--PioneerStarterPack by 丢雷楼某](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3441802113).

Pioneer Starter Pack rewards players for being online by paying them in in-game credits - up to 100,000 - every 20 minutes.

In addition, new players are given a start pack currently consisting of:
* 50,000 Credits
* 5,000 Iron
* Unusual (Green) Civil Fire Control Expansion Module x1
* Unusual (Green) Military Fire Control Expansion Module x1
* Unusual (Green) Refined Mining Laser x1

## Major Changes

* The original pack was tailored specifically to a specific server run by 丢雷楼某.  I am doing my best to strip out any branded content.
* Translations were largely done by Google Translate.  I have looked at it with my own eyes and cleaned up the worst of it, but I fully expect to have screwed up a lot.

## License

The original mod this was derived from seems to be under the MIT license, but if the mod author wants me to change that, it's fine.
